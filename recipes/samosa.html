        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> Dough - Combine ingredients form a crumbly mixture. Slowly add enough water to make a pliable dough, not too soft. Divide the dough and shape into balls. Keep aside for 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in potatoes and peas; cook until potatoes are tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, mash together, and set aside.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf; stir until fragrant and seeds are browned. Add ground beef and onions; cook until beef is browned and crumbly and onions are soft, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Step 4:</b> Stir in garlic and ginger. Season with salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and black pepper. Stir in the mashed potato mixture. Remove from heat and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until cool.</li>
            <li><b>Step 5:</b> Now that the stuffing is ready, prepare the outer layer (pastry layer) for the Samosas: Take each piece of dough and roll in your palms first. Then roll it with a rolling pin into a circle (doesn’t have to be a perfect circle), making the dough about 1/8 of an inch thick. Cut diagonally through the center of the samosa pastry with a knife or a pastry cutter.</li>
            <li><b>Step 6:</b> Form a cone with the samosa pastry. Stuff the samosa cone with the potato-beef filling, press the ends firmly so that the filling does not come out during the deep frying process. Repeat this process for each samosa.</li>
            <li><b>Step 7:</b> Heat enough oil for frying in a deep saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li><b>Step 8:</b> Drop the samosas into the oil slowly and deep fry them till golden brown, turning them carefully to the other side so that it cooks on all sides. Deep fry on medium heat Note: It’s better to make samosas in batches. Roll out, stuff and deep fry 5-6 samosas at a time While preparing the next batch of samosas, reduce the stove flame and carry out the process. When deep frying the next batch, see that the oil is hot enough to deep fry. Keep the prepared samosas covered throughout the preparation process.</li>
